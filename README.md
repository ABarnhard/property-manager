An object oriented application that simulates managing an apartment complex.

This project demonstrates:

* Using asynchronous functions to save and retrieve data from a MongoDB database.
* Recreate correct object prototype links using the lo-dash.io Node module.
* Integrate Travis-ci & coveralls badges for improved code quality assurance.
* Using Mocha's Before & BeforeEach functions to load and clear test datasets from the database.
